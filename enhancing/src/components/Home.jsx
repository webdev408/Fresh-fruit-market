        This is a second CRUD application built with react and vite. Here we
        have used nothing other than react-router-dom for routing. It is a pure
        react application. Here you can see create, read, update/edit and delete
        javascript functions at play. This ensures that react with its vast
        ecosystem can work with minimal plugins and installations. If you want
        to incorporate emojis, icons and other buttons and popoffs and tooltips,
        you can use many other react plugins and libraries.
